### Visualization of a selected route, showing the position of the buses and their next stop regarding that route.

You can check out the project [here](https://lsparkzwz.github.io/atac-bus-position-route-and-next-stop-visualization/) or by deploying the project yourself by serving the Index.html (or by directly opening it after temporarly turning off CORS on your browser).  

This project doesn't show data in real time, it only shows a snapshot of data obtained from [here](https://github.com/LSparkzwz/atac-bus-position-open-data-ingestion-system).
